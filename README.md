- Basic project setup


### Script "completion" checklist

Below is a full list of points that I personally like to go through when developing a high end 
goldfarming script

- [ ] Perform the method optimally
- [ ] Config
- [ ] Banking
- [ ] Death handling
- [ ] Restocking
  - [ ] Including retry strategies if items take too long to buy or sell
- [ ] Recharging/refilling items (blowpipe, rune pouch, repairing armor if desirable)
- [ ] If not done via muling - find a way for accs to self sustain supplies/bonds (Typically 
  selling items or alching loot)
- [ ] Muling (typically after a unique item is received, or after X wealth is made)
- [ ] Miscellenous features
  - [ ] Combat style switching
  - [ ] World hopping 
    - [ ] Extra world hop configurations (ignore AUS worlds, ignore EU worlds)
- [ ] Discord Webhooks
